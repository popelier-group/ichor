    """
    A helper class that wraps around a directory which contains points (molecules with various geometries).
    Calling Directory.__init__(self, path) will call the `parse` method of PointsDirectory instead of Directory
    (because Python looks for the method in this class first before looking at parent class methods.) A typical ICHOR
    directory that contains points will points will have a structure like this:

    .. code-block:: text

        -TRAINING_SET

            -- SYSTEM_NAME001
            -- SYSTEM_NAME002
            ........

    Each of the subdirectories contains Gaussian files (such as .gjf),
    as well as an `atomic_files` directory, which then contains the AIMALL files.
    A `PointsDirectory` will wrap around the whole TRAINING_SET directory
    (which contains multiple points), while a `PointDirectory` will wrap around a SYSTEM_NAME00...
    folder (which only contains information about 1 point).

    :param path: Path to a directory which contains points.
        This path is typically the path to the training set, sample pool, etc.
    :param needs_parsing: By default, every PointsDirectory is parsed when the instance is created to
        create PointDirectory instances of each inner directory (but the contents of the files are not read).
        If however, a slice of a already created PointsDirectory is made, the contents of the directories
        do not need to be parsed again, so needs_parsing would be false
